## Overview

SysEleven Stack Block Storage Service is built on the OpenStack Cinder project.
The Block Storage Service adds persistent block storage to your compute instances.

You can manage your block storage volumes and make them available to your compute instances both via our public OpenStack API endpoints, as well as using the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.cloud.syseleven.net).

You can also create snapshots from your block storages volumes, which you can use as a boot image or as a template for the creation of other block storage volumes.

### Optimal storage alignment

The alignment within images that SysEleven distributes is already configured optimally.

To boost the performance of the virtual volumes the following settings are advisable:

```shell
mkfs.ext4 -q -L myVolumeLabel -E stride=2048,stripe_width=10240
```

## Questions & Answers

### Can I use a block storage volume across multiple VMs simultaneously?

Unfortunately this is not possible. Think of a block storage volume like a virtual hard disk - just as you cannot connect a hard disk to multiple computers at the same time, you cannot connect a block storage volume to multiple compute instances at the same time.

### How can I get shared storage inside SysEleven Stack?

There are multiple options, for instance:

* S3 (SEOS) - provided as part of the SysEleven Stack
* NFS, GlusterFS, Ceph - interim solution for legacy applications

For the NFS case, we provide a [shared volume](https://github.com/syseleven/heat-examples/tree/master/shared-volume) template with multiple automatically connecting NFS clients, which you can use with our orchestration service.
