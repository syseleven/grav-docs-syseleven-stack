SysEleven Stack offers two flavors of ephemeral storage. The default storage type is a distributed storage based on quobyte. It offers high performance, redundancy and scalability at the cost of latency. For some application workloads, where latency is a bottleneck, we offer local ssd storage.

Please find more info about local storage in the [FAQ](https://docs.syseleven.de/helpcenter/de/taxonomy?name=tag&val=localstorage).
