## Overview

This tutorial explains how to launch a single instance with pre-installed OpenStack Client using the Horizon dashboard (GUI).
The kickstart instance contains all necessary tools to get started with the OpenStack Client.

## Goal

* Launch a jumphost/kickstart instance via GUI (Horizon)
* Automated installation of the the OpenStack Client in the new instance

## Prerequisites

* You need to have the login data for the SysEleven Stack API (user name and passphrase)
* Knowledge how to utilise a terminal/SSH and SSH-keys

---

## Import SSH keys

* Upload your SSH key(s) to the Horizon Dashboard - see [SSH Tutorial](../01.ssh-keys/docs.en.md)

## Launch Stack

* Log in to the [SysEleven Stack Dashboard](https://dashboard.cloud.syseleven.net) using the username and password (API credentials) that were provided by SysEleven.

* In order to launch the example stack using the dashboard go to "Project" --> "Orchestration" --> "Stacks".  

![horizon-orchestration-stacks](../../images/horizon-orchestration-stacks.png)

* Click the button "Launch Stack"
* Select "URL" as "Template Source"
* Copy the URL of the example code file `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syseleven/heat-examples/master/kickstart/kickstart.yaml`
* Paste the copied URL into the field "Template URL"
* Select "File" as "Environment Source"  

![horizon-orchestration-stacks-launch-url-file](../../images/horizon-orchestration-stacks-launch-url-file.png)

* Click "Next"
* Write a name for this stack into the field "Stack Name"
* Write the name of your SSH key that you uploaded to the Horizon Dashboard - see [Import SSH key(s)](#import-ssh-keys)
* Click on "Launch"

* Verify that the stack status is "Create In Progress" or "Create Complete"

* Go to "Compute" --> "Instances" in order to retrieve the floating IP that is required to access the instance via SSH  

![horizon-compute-instances](../../images/horizon-compute-instances.png)

* Copy the floating IP from the kickstart server  

![horizon-compute-instances-kickstart-fip](../../images/horizon-compute-instances-kickstart-fip.png)

* Open a terminal of your choice and log in to the instance via ssh with the username `syseleven`  

`ssh syseleven@<floating IP> -i ~/.ssh/< private ssh key >`

* You should now be logged in your instance via SSH

## Conclusion

You launched an OpenStack instance using a simple IaC (Infrastructure as Code) heat example template.  
This instance can be used as "jumphost" to work with the OpenStack client CLI. All required tools are pre-installed already.  
The instance is available via SSH and ready to be used for further tasks.
