## How to repartition VM disk

### Overview

This Document will show you the essential steps to repartition your VM disk. For this purpose we are using an Ubuntu 18.04 server as example with the `m1c.tiny` [flavor](../../04.Reference/03.compute/docs.en.md).

We strongly recommend to use the automatic approach but for instructional use we are also covering the manual process here.


### Prerequisites

* You need to have the login data for the SysEleven Stack API (user name and passphrase)
* Knowledge how to utilise a terminal/SSH and SSH-keys.

### Automatically configure partitions

By default [cloudinit](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) will grow your VM image partition size to the complete size of the ephemeral disk (which is defined by the flavor you used for your VM). To avoid this behavior and use the spare space for a new partition we will use following snippet :

```shell
#cloud-config
growpart:
  mode: off
runcmd:
# Parted asks whether to fix /dev/vda to use all available space, we reply "Fix" and continue
# Resize primary partition to 10GiB
- "printf 'Fix\n1\nyes\n10GB\n' | parted ---pretend-input-tty /dev/vda resizepart"
# Prepare partitions
- "parted -s /dev/vda mkpart DATA ext4 10GB 20GB"
- "parted -s /dev/vda mkpart DATA ext4 20GB 50GB"
# Configure new partitions
- "echo $(parted /dev/vda -s print|grep DATA |awk '/^\ *[0-9]+/{print $1}') > /partition_nums.txt"
- "for i in $(cat /partition_nums.txt); do mkfs.ext4 /dev/vda${i}; done"
- "for i in $(cat /partition_nums.txt); do e2label /dev/vda${i} DATA${i}; done"
- "for i in $(cat /partition_nums.txt); do mkdir -p /mnt/disks/data${i}; done"
- "for i in $(cat /partition_nums.txt); do mount -t ext4 /dev/vda${i} /mnt/disks/data${i}; done"
- "for i in $(cat /partition_nums.txt); do echo LABEL=DATA${i} /mnt/disks/data${i} ext4 defaults 0 0 | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab; done"
# System is not aware of new space on main partition. Needs refresh.
- "resize2fs /dev/vda1"
```

This snippet was written for a Ubuntu 18.04 VM with a 50GiB ephemeral disk. It will resize the main partition to 10 GiB and create 2 new partitions (10 GiB and 30 GiB), create an ext-4 filesystem and mount them.

Using the OpenStack dashboard to start your VM you may provide this snippet in the `Customization Script` box located in the `Configuration` tab. If you prefer to use the CLI to bring up the VM, you can use the `--user-data` option to provide the cloud-config file containing the snippet.

Inside of the provisioned VM you may see the following :

```shell
ubuntu@partition-test:~$ df -h
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
udev            985M     0  985M   0% /dev
tmpfs           200M  648K  199M   1% /run
/dev/vda1       8.9G  1.1G  7.9G  12% /
tmpfs           997M     0  997M   0% /dev/shm
tmpfs           5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock
tmpfs           997M     0  997M   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
/dev/vda15      105M  3.6M  101M   4% /boot/efi
/dev/vda2       9.2G   37M  8.6G   1% /mnt/disks/data2
/dev/vda3        28G   45M   26G   1% /mnt/disks/data3
tmpfs           200M     0  200M   0% /run/user/1000
```

### Manually configure partitions

In contrast to the automatic disk partioning, we will do the steps by hand which would be needed to create a new partition. All we need to do is to tell [cloudinit](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) via user-data to not grow the initial VM image partition.

```shell
#cloud-config
growpart:
  mode: off
```

The following steps will guide you through the process of manually creating a separate partition.

#### Check existing partitions

To be able to check the partitions we need to use ssh to connect to the VM. We further need to get root rights. Having done so, we can see the following :

```shell
$ root@partition-test:~# df -h
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
udev            3.9G     0  3.9G   0% /dev
tmpfs           798M  648K  798M   1% /run
/dev/vda1       2.0G  1.1G  948M  53% /
tmpfs           3.9G     0  3.9G   0% /dev/shm
tmpfs           5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock
tmpfs           3.9G     0  3.9G   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
/dev/vda15      105M  3.6M  101M   4% /boot/efi
tmpfs           798M     0  798M   0% /run/user/1000

$ root@partition-test:~# parted /dev/vda --script "print free"
Warning: Not all of the space available to /dev/vda appears to be used, you can fix the GPT to use all of the space (an extra 100245504 blocks) or continue with the current setting?

        2361MB  53.7GB  51.3GB  Free Space

root@partition-test:~#
```

As we can see, our partitation /dev/vda1 did not grow and got the original size of the image itself. In consequence we have 51,3GB free space, which we may use for our new partition.

#### Create new partition

In order to use the free space, we have to relocate the backup data structures to the end of the disk. We are using [gdisk](https://linux.die.net/man/8/gdisk) in expert mode to do so.

```shell
root@partition-test:~# gdisk
GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.3

Type device filename, or press <Enter> to exit: /dev/vda
Partition table scan:
  MBR: protective
  BSD: not present
  APM: not present
  GPT: present

Found valid GPT with protective MBR; using GPT.

  14            2048           10239   4.0 MiB     EF02

```

The next step is to create our new partition. We will use all the free space and create a new `/dev/vda2` partition.

```shell
Command (? for help): n

First sector (34-104857566, default = 4612096) or {+-}size{KMGTP}:

Current type is 'Linux filesystem'

Command (? for help): w

Final checks complete. About to write GPT data. THIS WILL OVERWRITE EXISTING
PARTITIONS!!

Do you want to proceed? (Y/N): Y
OK; writing new GUID partition table (GPT) to /dev/vda.
Warning: The kernel is still using the old partition table.
The new table will be used at the next reboot or after you
run partprobe(8) or kpartx(8)
The operation has completed successfully.
```

To be able to see the new partition we need to reload the partition table.

```shell
root@partition-test:~# partprobe
root@partition-test:~# ls /dev | grep vda2
vda2
```

#### Create filesystem on new partition

Now that we have our new partition, the next step is to create a filesystem on it. We will go with `ext4` in this example.

```shell
# Lets create an ext4 filesystem
root@partition-test:/home/ubuntu# mkfs.ext4 /dev/vda2
mke2fs 1.44.1 (24-Mar-2018)
Creating filesystem with 12530683 4k blocks and 3137536 inodes
Filesystem UUID: a6edfdf1-23dd-4b1d-af45-493a8d0fd986
Superblock backups stored on blocks:
 32768, 98304, 163840, 229376, 294912, 819200, 884736, 1605632, 2654208,
 4096000, 7962624, 11239424

Allocating group tables: done
Writing inode tables: done
Creating journal (65536 blocks): done
Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information:
done
```

The very last step is to mount the partition

```shell
root@partition-test:~# mount /dev/vda2 /mnt
root@partition-test:~# lsblk
NAME    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
vda     252:0    0   50G  0 disk
├─vda1  252:1    0  2.1G  0 part /
├─vda2  252:2    0 47.8G  0 part /mnt
├─vda14 252:14   0    4M  0 part
└─vda15 252:15   0  106M  0 part /boot/efi
```

If you want the mount to be persistent after a reboot you also have to adjust the fstab configuration file.

```shell
root@partition-test:~# blkid /dev/vda2
/dev/vda2: UUID="8b1aba77-feb7-4bdb-83e8-35879411059c" TYPE="ext4" PARTLABEL="Linux filesystem" PARTUUID="8adfef00-93d8-4b05-944e-cce09bb66f3a"

echo "UUID=8b1aba77-feb7-4bdb-83e8-35879411059c /mnt ext4 defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
```

### Conclusion

We have started a VM using custom user data which prevents the growing of the VM root partition to the complete size of the ephemeral disk. Afterwards we have used the resulting free disk space to create a custom partition. In the end we have created a new ext4 filesystem on the new partition and mounted it so we can use it.
